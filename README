Setup Instructions

1. Make a folder called bin in your home directory

2. In your bin directory git clone git@github.com:neil477/dotfiles.git

3.
  Add to .emacs file:   (load "~/bin/dotfiles/dotemacs/init.el")

  (Optional) if you want my zshell stuff Add to .zshrc directory in your home folder: source ~/bin/dotfiles/zshrc
  

4. In your .emacs.d folder: git clone https://github.com/dimitri/el-get.git

5. Startup emacs and it should be should be glorious


Make Emacs Your Own:

E.g. Change Theme

1. Default theme is zenburn. To change this go to ~/bin/dotfiles/dotemacs/init.el, locate '(load-theme zenburn), 
change zenburn to some other cool themes: currently I have solarized-light-theme and solarized-theme in addition 
to zenburn, but plan to add more. you can add your own theme just make sure you put it in the themes directory in 
the dotemacs folder. Follow the name-theme.el convention, and reference it truncating the -theme.el suffix when you 
load it. i.e. zenburn-theme.el in the themes directory is loaded by calling '(load-theme zenburn)

2. Do other cool stuff that I know not about, and tell me.
